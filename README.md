# ppls-fmri-pipelines
Data processing pipelines for cognitive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies at the Department of Psychology, the University of Edinburgh.

* [`preproc-fmriprep`](https://github.com/tammandres/ppls-fmri-pipelines/tree/master/preproc-fmriprep): scripts and instructions for preprocessing single-echo fMRI data on a computer cluster using fMRIPrep (via udocker container).
* [`preproc-multiecho`](https://github.com/tammandres/ppls-fmri-pipelines/tree/master/preproc-multiecho): scripts and instructions for preprocessing multi-echo fMRI data on a computer cluster. The scripts are mainly based on SPM12 toolbox and [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io) Python package.
